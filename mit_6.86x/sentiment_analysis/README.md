# **Sentiment Analysis Classifier for Amazon Food Product Reviews**

---

---

## **📌 Project Overview**

This project aims to design a **sentiment analysis classifier** to evaluate product reviews. The training dataset consists of Amazon customer reviews for various food products. These reviews, originally provided on a 5-point scale, have been adjusted to a binary scale for classification:

- **+1**: Positive review
- **-1**: Negative review

The primary objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify the sentiment of these reviews into positive or negative categories.

## **✨ Features**

- **Binary Sentiment Classification**: Predicts whether a review is positive (+1) or negative (-1).
- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization of textual data.
- **Machine Learning Model Implementation**: Uses algorithms for sentiment classification.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Provides metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

## **📂 Dataset**

The dataset is composed of Amazon customer reviews for food products. Each review has been labeled as either positive (+1) or negative (-1).

### **Dataset Structure**

Each entry in the dataset contains:

1. **Review Text**: The actual content of the product review.
2. **Sentiment Label**: A binary value indicating the sentiment (+1 or -1).
